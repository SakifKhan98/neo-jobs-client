# Neo Jobs - Job Portal

## Developed using MERN Stack

There is a release rollout going on in my current company. So, I did not get the time to
implement all the features as described in the Instruction PDF and there are some bugs in this web app.

But I can explain how I can implement the other features mentioned in the instruction manual if necessary.

## Features

Here a user can login as Employer or Job Seeker.
If a user logs in as Employer S/He will be asked for Card Details.

This payment gateway is setup using Stripe.
The default testing card number is 4242 4242 4242 4242 and Expire Date can be any future date,
and CVC with Zip code can be any random numbers.

Then the user can post jobs which will be shown in the Home Page.

2. Ant Design
3. NodeJS
4. ExpressJS
